##What is AvoCraft
AvoCraft is like a 2D version of Minecraft. It was originally called "CodeCraft" and was on the Raspberry Pi Projects page [here]https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/codecraft, but it is no longer being developed. AvoCraft is a continued version of CodeCraft made in Python.
